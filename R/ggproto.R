#' "ggproto" objects exported from the "ggscribble" package
#'
#' The \code{ggscribble} package defines several \code{ggproto} objects for
#' creating plots with a hand-drawn appearance. These objects serve as the
#' foundation for the geoms, scales and guides in this package. The casual user
#' does not need to know anything about these objects, but they are exported
#' so that they can be explored and used by ggplot extension developers.
#'
#' @details
#' ggproto objects in ggplot2 define the behavior of geoms, stats, and other
#' components by encapsulating methods and default settings. They allow for
#' inheritance and method overriding, making it easier to create new geoms
#' and stats by building upon existing ones. For a detailed description see
#'  \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot2-ggproto}}.
